### Grin exists to open electronic transactions to all, without censorship or restrictions.

Grin empowers anyone to transact or save modern money without the fear of external control or oppression. Grin is designed for the decades to come, not just tomorrow. Grin should be accessible to all, regardless of boundaries, culture, skills or access.
